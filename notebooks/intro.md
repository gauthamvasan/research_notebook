Dear seeker of silent epiphanies, <br>
There are moments—brief, electric—when everything clicks, and the world inside your head aligns with the one outside. In those flashes, your eyes light up, and for just a breath, it feels like you’ve touched something essential about your own existence. But just as often, you crash headlong into failure—sudden, jarring, and unwelcome. It’s like hitting a wall you didn’t see coming, the impact leaving fractures in your confidence and splinters in your thinking. Still, you return. You sift through the fragments, trying again—determined to become a better researcher, a clearer thinker, someone who holds questions with care, even when the answers resist you.

This is my research notebook: a space for humble attempts—to organize what I’ve read, to distill what I’ve understood (or think I have), and to untangle what still confuses me. It won’t always be polished, but it will be honest—part record, part reflection, and wholly part of the process.
